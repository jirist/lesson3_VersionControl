## Project Description:
The subject of this assignment is an introduction to version control and why is version control important?

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Structured system to store different versions of our work and track the development of files should be used on all levels, whether working alone, with a team or on a personal project.
2. There are two general varieties of version control systems; centralized and distributed. Centralized version control system keeps a single repository residing on a central server and works in a client and server relationship. With decentralized version control system each user has their own repository that has the entire history of the project. Based on a peer to peer approach, users can synchronize with each other without having to go through a central repository.
3. One of the most popular version control system in use today is Git. To use Git, the developer uses commands executed from a command line. Every time a file is added, modified or removed, the change is being committed to the repository through standard Git commit process.
